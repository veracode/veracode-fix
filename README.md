# Veracode Fix GitHub Action

The Veracode Fix GitHub Action uses the Veracode AI-assisted remediation service, [Veracode Fix](https://docs.veracode.com/r/About_Veracode_Fix),to generate AI-generated code patches and review suggested patches for flaws in your code. It applies these patches to flaws in a new branch and creates a pull request for you to review, approve, and merge.

For instructions on configuring and using the GitHub action in your repository, go to the [Veracode Documentation](https://docs.veracode.com) and search for Veracode Fix GitHub Action.
